--For each branch, developers write the test cases after development, build in local, testing
--Then we'll merge it in main branch

CI: Developers continuosly merge their code frequently into a shared repo
Each Merge triggers an automated build and testing process
To ensure the changes do not break the existing functionality


CD: 

1. Repo = Project folder exists
2. Dev Env = Server, EC2 instance etc (Dockers) -> testing
3. QA Env = QA team do the testing
4. UAT (Pre Prod) = further testing
5. Prod Env


1. Workflows
--Series of steps developers follows to write, test, collaborate and deploy code effectively

a. Coding (Ex: VS Code)
b. Version Control (Git) = manages code base
c. Code Review - Peer code review, Architect code review, best practices, code style etc
d. Testing - Automated Testing

Unit testing
Integrated Testing
End to end testing

e. CI
Automated CI Pipeline:
--Once the PR is opened, CI Pipeline is automatically triggered
--This pipeline builds the application and runs all test cases
--If pipeline passes, PR is approved and code is merged with the main branch

d. CD - deploy in diff env (Dev, QA, UAT, Prod)
--Upon Merging the PR, CD pipeline is triggered
--The application is automatically deployed to Dev/Staging Env
--Upon all the testing
--Deployed to Prod env
