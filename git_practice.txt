Git and Github for DE:

--Git is a Version control system
--Think of it like a time machine for your code
--We can work in teams without messing up each other's work 

--Git is the tool you use on yout local computer
--Github is where you store and share your git projects on the cloud
--you can collaborate with others, review code, track issues etc

--Repo is just a project folder tracked by Git
--can be stored locally or remotely on Github

Note: Best to use power shell for learning git

1. git status
2. git config --global user.email "pradyumnaburly22@gmail.com"
   git config --global user.name "pradyumnaburly"
3. git init

Note: Don't touch .git folder
4. git branch - lists all branches

Note: In order to register a branch, it should have atleast 1 commit
when we initially run git branch, it will not even show master branch

5. git add . = adds all untracked files to staging layer
--working directory = where u do a development
--all files in working directory is hidden to git, unless we tell it to track
--in staging area it takes snapshot of the files
--flow: working directory -> staging area -> repo 


File States:
1. Untracked - U 
2. Staged - A 
3. Modified - M 

6. git commit -m "message"
--Best practice is to structure the message in simple present tense
--HEAD = Latest commit in the branch
--Whenever we create a branch, it is created from the HEAD of the current branch

7. git log
logs = Metadata
git log --oneline = in simple lines

Note: Git don not create empty folders
Note: to include empty folder, we should add a file in that folder called .gitkeep

### Git branches

--Each branch is isolated
--Ancester commit and merge commit
8. git switch master = to go to master branch
git switch -c fetaure_1 = creates and goes to that branch
git branch = lists all the branches
