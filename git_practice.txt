Git and Github for DE:

--Git is a Version control system
--Think of it like a time machine for your code
--We can work in teams without messing up each other's work 

--Git is the tool you use on yout local computer
--Github is where you store and share your git projects on the cloud
--you can collaborate with others, review code, track issues etc

--Repo is just a project folder tracked by Git
--can be stored locally or remotely on Github

Note: Best to use power shell for learning git

1. git status
2. git config --global user.email "pradyumnaburly22@gmail.com"
   git config --global user.name "pradyumnaburly"
3. git init

Note: Don't touch .git folder
4. git branch - lists all branches

Note: In order to register a branch, it should have atleast 1 commit
when we initially run git branch, it will not even show master branch
